%%% @doc This module contains 'ord' skeleton initialization logic.
%%%
%%% The 'ord' skeleton can reorder outputs from its inner skeletons such that
%%% they have the same order coming out the ord skeleton as they had going into
%%% it.
%%%
%%% This becomes useful when requiring ordering on things like a farm.
%%% 
%%% === Example ===
%%% 
%%%   ```skel:run([{ord, [{farm, [{seq, fun ?MODULE:p/1}], 10}]}], Inputs)'''
%%%
%%%   In this example we wrap the `ord' skeleton around a farm of ten 
%%%   workers, each of which are running the developer-defined `p/1' in 
%%%   sequential functions. The result of this is that the returned 
%%%   applications of the input to `p/1' is in the same order as the list 
%%%   of inputs `Inputs' itself.
